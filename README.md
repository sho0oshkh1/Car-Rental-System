# Car-Rental-System

A small Car Rental Company needs a system to manage its rental cars. It has a variety of cars from different car makers (e.g. Honda, Nissan, BMW, etc.), but only one of each therefore allowing the company to identify their cars by their make. The company currently has 10 cars and hopes to expand in the future to have up to 100 different cars.
The company keeps track of the kilometers each car travels during each rental by storing the start and the end kilometer standing for each rental period. Each car has a certain fuel economy which is measured in the number of kilometers the car can travel per liter of gasoline. And it keeps track of which car is currently rented and which is not.


The company needs a menu-driven system allowing the following actions:
1.	Add a new car 
2.	Rent out a car
3.	Accept a returned car
4.	Display car info
5.	Display company status
6.	Exit
